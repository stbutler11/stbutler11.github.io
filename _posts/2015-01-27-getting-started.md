## Quickly getting up and running with GitHub pages

The easiest way I've found to get set up is to:

- Clone the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub
- Edit _config.yml
- Use [Prose.io](http://prose.io) to edit the posts.
- Don't forget to publish them in Prose.io
